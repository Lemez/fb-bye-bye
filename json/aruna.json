Smt.ARUNA SAIRAM (Born 30 October 1952), Indian Carnatic Classical Vocalist, on her Birthday today. She is a recipient of the Padma Shri award from the Government of India. She has been elected as Vice-Chairman of the Sangeet Natak Akademi (India's premier national institution for music and dance) from the Government of India. She is regarded as the Music Ambassador of India, for successfully taking Indian music to the global arena. Steeped in bhava-expression and classical divinity, Aruna Sairam's music evokes bhakti-devotion in every listener's soul. She has dazzled audiences at prestigious musical venues in India and around the world through her scintillating performances and refreshing approach.\n\nAruna Sairam was born in Mumbai into a family with a deep love of music. Aruna Sairam initially received vocal training from her mother Rajalakshmi Sethuraman, who was a disciple of the Alathur Brothers and Thanjavoor Sankara Iyer.  Her father, Shri Sethuraman, a music connoisseur, hosted many musicians and dancers from northern and southern India in the family home. One of these gatherings led to Aruna meeting her Guru, Sangita Kalanidhi Smt. T. Brinda, who trained her in the style of her own mentor, Veena Dhanammal.\n\nAs a child, Aruna demonstrated an extraordinary aptitude for music. It won her first gold medal at the age of eight at the Shanmukhananda Sabha Competition in Mumbai. Aged 14, she performed her first full-length solo concert at the Rama Navami festival, Bhajana Samaj in the same city. Aged 21, she won the Best Young Musician Award at the annual conference held at the famed Music Academy in Chennai. Aruna began to get noticed as a serious musician of great promise and went on to render performances throughout the country.\n\nOver the following years Aruna brought her own approach to Carnatic music, drawing on the cosmopolitan influences of Mumbai and, coevally, on her Guru’s pure classical style. Her musical perceptions were enriched by exposure to film, western and Hindustani (Northern Indian) classical music. She ushered in a new approach to concert presentation, extending the boundaries of the Carnatic repertoire while remaining firmly rooted in the classical grammar and tradition of this great art form.\n\nAruna’s parental home was host to one of the scions of the Uttukadu family, Needamanagalam Krishnamurthy Bhagavathar,  who spent months in their Mumbai home, performing and teaching these compositions. Aruna has played a key role in propagating these brilliant, yet relatively neglected compositions and revealing them on the contemporary concert stage. The abhang is soulful music, traditionally sung by pilgrims as they travelled by foot to the temple of Lord Vitthala in Pandharpur, Maharashtra in western India. As they walk, they dance and sing abhangs expressing their devotion with spiritual abandon and engagement. Aruna’s interest in this form started with listening to the profound and passionate singing of leading satsang exponents who frequented her parental house. Roughly speaking in Indian philosophical terms, satsang is a ball of yarn that envelops seekers of, and seeking the truth. She was greatly influenced by Pandit Bhimsen Joshi's Abhangavani – a series of Abhang concerts.\n\nWhen on stage Aruna enters into another realm. The audience, while listening to her and watching her perform, experiences a timeless and spaceless sensation. Audiences pack her concerts. Her unique qualities render her music both virtuosic and one-off memorable. Her performances exude the living ginger of her academic and musical pedigree. For example, her ability to handle the highly aesthetic and eclectic padam form, the energised thillana form and ragam-tanam-pallavi– considered the highest challenge in Carnatic music – combines solid grooming and grounding and the spontaneity of the moment. Her compositions are further proof positive of her impeccable scholarship and musical passions.\n\nNational presence Aruna has had the rare distinction of performing in such venues as the Indian President's official residence– Rashtrapati Bhavan, at Shakthi Sthal – and the memorials to Indian Prime Ministers, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi at Vir Bhoomi.[26] She has also performed across the length and breadth of the country, bringing the richness of South Indian classical music to people from all walks of life from major international cities to the humblest hamlets and rural villages. A sample of the venues might include: The Music Academy,[27] Chennai, the National Centre for the Performing Arts, Mumbai, Siri Fort Auditorium, Delhi, seminars and festivals of national importance such as those held at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts in Delhi,the Music Forum in Mumbai, and Kolkata’s Sangeet Research Academy.[22] International presence Aruna was one of her generation’s pioneering vocalists in the sense of sensitising international audiences to the sound and feel of South Indian vocal music. Her first international experience as a visiting professor was at a German music conservatory where she taught South Indian music; it exposed her to a new world of impressions and seeded new insights. She was intrigued at the lack of awareness of her art form outside the subcontinent. This experience gave her a new life mission: to make South Indian classical music global. One of the many instances when her dream saw fruition was when the BBC Proms invited her to perform at London’s Royal Albert Hall.[28][29] as the first South Indian classical vocalist in the Proms’ history – at that point in its 116-year history– in 2011. Aruna has also performed, among other important international venues, at New York’s Carnegie Hall, Théâtre de la Ville in Paris, and Morocco’s Fes Festival of World Sacred Music.\n\nAwards and recognitions:\nAruna considers herself deeply humbled and honoured by the many national and international awards conferred upon her. These include the Padma Shri and the US Congress Proclamation of Excellence, where upon the US national flag was flown atop the Capitol building with a special Congressional proclamation recognising her musical contribution.\n\nPadma Shri from the Government of India\nAruna Sairam has been appointed as Vice-Chairman of the prestigious Sangeet Natak Akademi, Delhi, 2015\nSangeet Natak Akademi Award, Government of India – 2014\nBharathi Thyagaraja Samman Award by Dakshinamnaya Sringeri Sharada Peetham, Bangalore – 2015\nIsai Mani Magudam Award by Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Chennai – 2015\nArsha Kala Bhushanam Award by Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, Coimbatore – 2014\nRajah Sir Annamalai Chettiar Award by Rajah Sir Annamalai Chettiar Memorial Trust Chennai – 2013\nShri P.
