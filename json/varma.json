Those people were saying exactly the same thing :) \"That music is going on in our  minds even now!\" they said. They spontaneously invited Varmaji to come on stage and they honoured him. I felt a bit greedy and hoped that they would ask him to Speak too, but that didn't happen. \nSri O.S.Arun though, spoke very warmly and affectionately about Varmaji. He said that Varmaji had just returned from America and still came for the concert and he sang Hari Hari Rama Nama as a special treat for Varmaji :) (Varmaji sings this tune, composed by O.S.Arun, though the same song is available in many other tunes too.) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dFvhSUvpao\nThe concert today was really beautiful and special.\nOne thing I felt was that rather than imitate each other, both \nSri Arun and Varmaji had come to the same conclusions about how music should be, independently! \nToday Sri Arun sang the beautiful Abhang Theerth Vittal and made the audience sing the first line along with him! It was just so mesmerizing and moving really! I am sure Vittala would be showering His blessings on special souls who don't just sing, but who put a song in Our hearts too, which goes on and on for a long long time, long after the concert has finished.","actions":[{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155374524589376"},{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155374524589376"}],"id":"101837289375_10155374524589376","from":{"name":"Mallika Madhan","id":"1562713107085614"},"type":"video","picture":"https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCUD8GPS3r52q77\u0026w=130\u0026h=130\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-dFvhSUvpao%2Fhqdefault.jpg\u0026cfs=1\u0026sx=90\u0026sy=0\u0026sw=360\u0026sh=360\u0026_nc_hash=AQAIUGRQrNd6g0fF","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dFvhSUvpao","created_time":"2017-06-17T16:11:02+0000","updated_time":"2017-06-17T18:12:34+0000"},{"message":"\"Mandahaasa suvadanaa\"...😊😊From the NJ concert.","actions":[{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155354980584376"},{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155354980584376"}],"id":"101837289375_10155354980584376","from":{"name":"Karthi Pillai","id":"457338717957533"},"type":"photo","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/18951297_451082755249796_7607133925136425783_n.jpg?oh=72a8d9d5d3451bd2f1ea8ac083311e27\u0026oe=59D4D33E","link":"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=451082755249796\u0026set=gm.10155354980584376\u0026type=3","created_time":"2017-06-11T08:32:53+0000","updated_time":"2017-06-17T08:45:15+0000"},{"message":"The students get the Guru's blessings","actions":[{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155370699729376"},{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155370699729376"}],"id":"101837289375_10155370699729376","from":{"name":"Mallika Madhan","id":"1562713107085614"},"type":"photo","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/19225757_1554463024577289_1937027649535149461_n.jpg?oh=f7177c545ffd28d23f019a1e4050911c\u0026oe=59C72586","link":"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1554463024577289\u0026set=gm.10155370699729376\u0026type=3","created_time":"2017-06-16T11:18:39+0000","updated_time":"2017-06-16T16:01:05+0000"},{"message":"Packing up one last time, after two months of classes and concerts :) And now the Indian segment begins!

Unlike any other concerts in NJ, where we see gray hair, bald head people in the audience, this concert attracted wide range of rasikas. In this photo we can't see half of the audience. The most precious kids were sitting in the front rows unmoved throughout the concert. I can't wait to see all those beautiful concert pics captured by Sheetal. \nRamaprasad ji has already wrote concert review in rasikas.org\n http://www.rasikas.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13\u0026t=29475\nRight from gambheera naata Varnam by Dr BMK to Sgmg by Kaiwara Amara nareyana, it was a beautiful musical treat for all of us. We got to enjoy variety of compositions with lot of insights. Varmaji and his accompanists always enjoy while performing and won't compete with each other and hence the joy gets infectious with the audience. All the workshop students were eagerly awaiting to sing along those songs with the team. The western note, thillana and Sri Rama 😊 omg ! How well they sang really! Kudos to all the students 👏👏 can't wait to watch the videos 😊Thank you so much sir for teaching us these beautiful songs, just within 2 days 🙏 \nAt the end of the concert, Varmaji gave a sweet surprise to Vinuji by asking all the audience to join and wish him for his birthday and that was so cute 😊 \nI am blessed to host these artists in my place. As always, Varmaji puts everybody at ease and our family was so comfortable hosting them 😊 We would love to have you in NJ again and again Sir 😊🙏\nI would like to address all those who helped in organizing this event as Varma sir fans of Tristate area.

Sri Rama Nee Naamamu _Kaivara Amara Nareyana composition tuned by\nM Balamuralikrishna\n\nAfter a long chat with Prince Rama Varma for a radio program a group of us host in NJ, I came away with the impression that he is a multifaceted person. He is a musician and a mentor, a musicologist and an articulator, a traditionalist and a trendsetter. Exposed to four different gurus, and many manasa gurus, his music has evolved as his own, with the underpinning of a harmonious blend of his diverse schooling. That was evident to me when I later attended his live concert here. For me, it has so far been only the web as a source of this music\n\nWithout meaning to be disrespectful, this concert was like a buffet. The musical fare offered was a variety of some familiar and some rare works (at least to this rasika). What I liked, as a rasika, was this additional feature – for many of the kritis he sang, it was also a teaching moment that made the soiree even more delectable. I hope more musicians indulge in this mentoring, as the concert proceeds, that can only make us more enlightened rasikas. Engaging the audience, thus, is something I have not always found in my meager concert experience. I also want to add that any mistakes below are my misunderstanding of what he said on stage.\n\nThe tana varnam of Balamuralikrishna was preceded by a short history of varnams, with special reference to the Viriboni varnam by Pacchimirium Adiyappier. The 1-2-3 pattern of the first three syllables of this kriti has been emulated by composers to follow. It was a very lively delivery of the varnam, with frictionless gliding over the chittai swarams. Next, the rendering of Deva Deva Kalayamethe brought out the beauty and grandeur of this fundamental raga.\nBalamuralimuralikrishna has brought to light many rare ragas, kritis and composers. His student has followed the trend. There are great composers from Kerala, in addition to the iconic Swathi Thirunal. One hardly hears their compositions. My two bit wisdom is that if we don’t sing them often, we will lose them. Rama Varma’s next piece, a kriti on Guruvayur Krishna, composed by Iraiman Thampi in Yadhukula Kambhoji, brought out not only the essence of this raga, but also the feeling how many such great compositions we are truly missing. That Iraiman Thampi was the teacher of Swathi Thirunal was also pointed out, especially for the benefit of a group of young people in the audience, who had just finished a two-day course under his tutelage. \n\nAfter dwelling briefly on other musical forms that Swathi Thirunal had immersed himself in, a piece from his opera, Kuchela Upakhyana, was rendered in Anandabhairavi. This particular song was tuned by Balamuralikrishna and it has several Anandabhairavi sancharas that were the creation of Prayaga Rangadasa (maternal grandfather of Balamuralikrishna). Rangadasa was a composer and musician in his own rights and his illustrious grandson has sung many of his works.\n\nThen followed a little gem of a composition of Thyagaraja in raga Suposhini (Janya of Harikambhoji). It is the only kriti in this raga. The Hariyum Haranum in Athana was preceded by an explanation of the sahitya whose essence was that whether it is Vishnu or Shiva, we are experiencing the same divinity.\n\nThe Kamavardhini kriti of Swathi Thirunal could be considered the center of gravity of the concert. It was, in my opinion, a tribute to M D Ramanathan. An in-depth and very contemplative immersion in the raga, with fragrances of the old master, but rendered with a feeling that can’t but touch our own hearts, was for me a spiritual moment.\n\nThen followed short pieces, very joyously rendered, and made for a fitting conclusion to the musical evening. The English Note and Sri Rama Nee Namamu was really musical fun, since his students were asked to join in. The chorus of voices in harmony was an aural delight. Another educational moment was learning about Kaivara Amara Nareyana, an eighteenth century yogi, who lived in Karnataka and composed many kritis. His works have been aired by, yes, Balamuralikrishna. He also tuned Sri Rama.\n\nI could write another essay of my heartfelt enjoyment of the three accompanists. Rama Varma told me, in his interview, that his concerts are always democratic, in the sense that he is not the center on the stage and the others are accompanying him. It is a team of four equals making great collaborative music. That needed no repetition as I followed his teammates on stage. What talent lurks in those fingers as they caress the violin, mridangam or ghatam. One had the additional good fortune of listening to Karthick’s konnakol. The privilege of listening to such a mature and gifted artist rendering this art form is not lost on this rasika. S R Vinu’s violin brought out and reaffirmed the melody just articulated by the vocalist with fidelity beyond explanation. The delicate touches on the mridangam by Harikumar, that was essentially a vocalization of music, was the other delight of the evening.\n\nYou see, it must have been very moving. I got carried away and wrote this long essay on my impression of the evening.\n\nRamaprasad\n\n","actions":[{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155357432764376"},{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155357432764376"}],"id":"101837289375_10155357432764376","from":{"name":"Ramya Belavadi","id":"10207529768962966"},"type":"link","picture":"https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQD2p6afVOv2-4YT\u0026w=130\u0026h=130\u0026url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rasikas.org%2Fcron.php%3Fcron_type%3Dcron.task.text_reparser.post_text%26sid%3Dcb427a6d467a68e57d932bad12b69b5a\u0026cfs=1\u0026_nc_hash=AQCXV3hwPXY7jts0","link":"http://www.rasikas.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13\u0026t=29475#p317583","created_time":"2017-06-12T02:56:12+0000","updated_time":"2017-06-12T18:15:43+0000"},{"message":"Rama Varma sir workshop in NJ went extremely well 😊 When I was listening to other workshop videos on YouTube earlier for the past couple of years, I always dreamed to attend his camps. And I was lucky enough to attend couple of them for the past two years in India. This time I am truly blessed to organize his workshop in NJ and the response was awesome as expected. I got to meet so many wonderful music friends through this event. Thank you so much Varmaji 😊 \n As the date was nearing, students number was increasing and I had to change the workshop venue to a bigger room 😊 we had 85 students registered for the class! Kids really rocked both days 😊 students, teachers, kids, adults, senior citizens, it was a mixed group and Varmaji catered everybody's needs as always. Even Kids younger than 6 years were sitting in 3 hours class completely focused on learning. On the first day, Varmaji taught western note. On the second day we learnt Dr M Balamuralikrishna thillana in Ahir Bhairav. I never imagined that he could teach one more song in the next short duration. He taught his signature sgmg Sri Rama nee naamamu by Kaiwara Amara Nareyana. Happy faces everywhere. And students are going to sing along with the dream time during tomorrow's concert ! Wow! Can't wait for Varmaji's concert and these workshop songs as well 😇 Both the days, I felt we had 2 mini concerts. Photo session was on and on and on after the teaching session. Attached is a short clipping of teaching process of Thillana. Music Teachers have so much to learn from him really.  \nAs music students watching his videos and meeting him in person, learning from him directly, means so much to us. Shanthi who attended the camp, expressed all of her happiness on behalf of the whole group so nicely. Uma Srinivasan who is a music teacher in NJ, pointed out every aspect of Varmaji as a Guru, which is valuable to every music student and teacher. Sri Kumar Venkataraman in his welcome speech at the beginning of the workshop mentioned a great sanskrit saying. \" 'Atmano mokshartham, Jagadhithayacha' - It means, after you attain salvation and bliss, share it with others and help them to attain peace and happiness.  I am glad to say, he has accomplished this goal.\"  So true really. 😊\nWe are blessed and lucky to have this opportunity to have these blissful days with Varmaji at the workshop 😇🙏","actions":[{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155349231229376"},{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155349231229376"}],"id":"101837289375_10155349231229376","from":{"name":"Ramya Belavadi","id":"10207529768962966"},"type":"video","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/19082036_10207432812539116_673828154824982528_n.jpg?oh=3c06e8017a609e60f7fd8d02a1d2da7e\u0026oe=5A112693","link":"https://www.facebook.com/10207529768962966/videos/10207432770898075","created_time":"2017-06-09T16:28:18+0000","updated_time":"2017-06-12T05:04:50+0000"},{"message":"All smiles 😊😄 ...","actions":[{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155356232894376"},{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/101837289375/posts/10155356232894376"}],"id":"101837289375_10155356232894376","from":{"name":"Mini Nayani","id":"1741035005924253"},"type":"photo","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/18952902_1727134743980946_1385585070541362285_n.jpg?oh=26619fd68f28c3b1adac4569bc7f6ce2\u0026oe=59E477E2","link":"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1727134743980946\u0026set=gm.10155356232894376\u0026type=3","created_time":"2017-06-11T18:08:57+0000","updated_time":"2017-06-12T03:50:47+0000"}]
