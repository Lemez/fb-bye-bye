The sea holds all the voices of the earth and those that come from outer space. Water receives impetus from the stars and transmits it to living creatures. Water, the longest border in Chile, also holds the secret of two mysterious buttons which were found on its ocean floor.

In it are the voices of the Patagonian Indigenous people, the first English sailors and also those of its political prisoners. Some say that water has memory. This film shows that it also has a voice. This documentary won in the 65th Berlin International Film Festival for Best Script, and also won in the Lumière’s Award for Best Documentary...

Karen marries him and they soon set off for his village, Stromboli. The village is on a remote island at the foot of an active volcano. She despairs at what she finds when she arrives. She doesn't speak the local dialect and is treated with disdain by some of the locals who see her as an exotic foreigner and a loose woman. Despite her efforts to fit in, the locals reject her and soon she comes to regard the island as a bigger prison than the one she just left.","id":"347569692013687_1276609129109734","from":{"name":"Auroville Social","id":"347569692013687"},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-11-30T08:43:56+0000","updated_time":"2017-12-01T17:10:01+0000"},{"actions":[{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/AurovilleSocial/posts/1276606059110041"}],"id":"347569692013687_1276606059110041","from":{"name":"Auroville Social","id":"347569692013687"},"type":"photo","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14956026_1501154866577784_957595691567645241_n.jpg?oh=14a6d85598e66b6e16231656ea3f1408\u0026oe=5A9388C3","link":"https://www.facebook.com/thebookloftberkshires/photos/a.469008116459136.122829.434847149875233/1501154866577784/?type=3","created_time":"2017-11-30T08:37:37+0000","updated_time":"2017-11-30T08:58:21+0000"},{"message":"SATURDAY ! \nDEEPAM CELEBRATION OF LIGHT\nSaturday 2. December 2017 - At 6 pm\n\nOnce again we will light more than a thousand oil-lamps which create a warm atmosphere. Karthigai Deepam has for centuries been celebrated. It originates from the legend of Lord Shiva who had transformed himself into a divine flame. A big fire is lit in this night on top of the holy mountain in Tiruvannamalai.\n\nDeepam means light - we chose this name for our project because we want to bring light into the lives of children who are disadvantaged.  At Deepam we work with children and youth with special needs from the surrounding villages.\n\nPlease drive from Kuilapalayam about 100m down the road towards the beach and enter on your right through the big orange gate into the Aspiration Campus.\nFollow the lights to reach Deepam.\nKindly be on time as there will be a short program by our children.","id":"347569692013687_1276624945774819","from":{"name":"Auroville Social","id":"347569692013687"},"type":"status","created_time":"2017-11-30T09:11:46+0000","updated_time":"2017-11-30T09:14:10+0000"},{"actions":[{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/AurovilleSocial/posts/1276582232445757"}],"id":"347569692013687_1276582232445757","from":{"name":"Auroville Social","id":"347569692013687"},"type":"video","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.0-10/s130x130/23826553_373990879678786_6185140557103235072_n.jpg?oh=cee1d9b751f8fd9ff12a7974c56d8c81\u0026oe=5A988982","link":"https://www.facebook.com/NTDTelevisionAU/videos/373987346345806/","created_time":"2017-11-30T07:57:18+0000","updated_time":"2017-11-30T07:57:18+0000"},{"message":"REMINDER TO ALL GUESTS from The Guest Facilities Coordination Group\nGUEST REGISTRATION SERVICE\n\nALL GUESTS in Auroville (including Indian nationals and foreigners as well as friends and family members of Aurovilians) are required by Indian law and Auroville regulations to register within 24 hours of their arrival.
